# MecSimCalc self hosted

You must first create your MecSimCalc app on https://mecsimcalc.com/create.

Once created, you can either:

- Publish directly to the [MecSimCalc platform](https://mecsimcalc.com/explore) for free

**OR**

- Download the app and host it yourself (eg. on a private server)
  - Follow these [instructions on self-hosting](https://docs.mecsimcalc.com/Self-Hosting-Apps/Overview)

_We recommend that you publish directly to the MecSimCalc platform for ease of use and to get the latest updates, however, self-hosting is available for advanced users_
